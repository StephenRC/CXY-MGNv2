12/13/16 - Spilt mgn12.scad into separate files for the various parts.

12/17/16 - It appears the x axis ends are tilting while moving.  May need to change to 2020 for the mgn rail mounts and metal end plates.

12/22/16 - Added a version of xy_bearing using 2020 to mount the mgn rail and using 1/4" aluminum for the mounting of both to the mgn rail.

12/30/16 beefed up the xy_bearing using al u-channel.
