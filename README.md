# CXY-MSNv2
A CoreXY printer using MGN12 rails and aluminum channel from a hardware store.

# This is a work in progress.

12/13/16 - Spilt mgn12.scad into separate files for the various parts.

12/17/16 - It appears the x axis ends are tilting while moving.  May need to change to 2020 for the mgn rail mounts and metal end plates.
